# Smart-API Work Order System

The Smart-API Work Order System is a backend management system developed in Go, featuring a decoupled architecture with Gin as the backend framework, and Vue.js and Element UI for the frontend. The system aims to efficiently handle work order management, supporting task allocation, execution monitoring, real-time updates, and more.

Based on Gin + Vue + Element UI OR Arco Design OR Ant Design, the front-end and back-end separated permission management system is extremely simple to initialize, requiring only configuration file modification for database connection. The system supports multi-command operations, and migration commands can simplify the initialization of database information, while service commands can easily start the API service.

- **Other Tools**: Docker, Swagger, GIT

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Preparation

You need to install [go] [gin] [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) locally.

## üì¶ Environment Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
- Node.js v14.16.0 or higher
- npm version: 6.14.11
- MySQL or other compatible databases
- Docker (optional)

### Backend Installation Steps

1. Clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sunwenbo/smart-api.git
    cd smart-api
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. Configure database connection information:

   Modify the database connection information in `config/settings.yml`, ensuring the database configuration is correct.

4. Initialize the database:

    ```bash
    # Initial configuration requires database resource information initialization
    # Use on macOS or Linux
    $ ./smart-api migrate -c config/settings.dev.yml
   
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Use on Windows
    $ smart-api.exe migrate -c config/settings.dev.yml

    # Start the project, can also use IDE for debugging
    # Use on macOS or Linux
    $ ./smart-api server -c config/settings.yml
    
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Use on Windows
    $ smart-api.exe server -c config/settings.yml
    ```

5. How to add data to the sys_api table

   When starting the project, using `-a true` will automatically add missing interface data.
   ```bash
   ./smart-api server -c config/settings.yml -a true
   ```
6. Document generation:
   ```bash
   go generate
   ```
7. Start the service:
   ```
   ./smart-api server -c config/settings.yml
   ```

#### Using Docker for Compilation and Start

```azure

```

#### Cross Compilation
   ```bash
   # windows
   env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
   
   # or
   # linux
   env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
   ```

### Frontend Installation Steps

1. Clone the frontend project:

    ```bash

## Usage Instructions

1. **Login to the system**: Use the default administrator account `admin` to log in.
2. **Create Work Orders**: Go to the task management page, click "Create Work Order", fill in the relevant information, and assign a handler.
3. **Task Execution Monitoring**: You can view the execution status, results, and logs of tasks in real-time through the task execution interface in the system.
4. **Work Order Rating and Comments**: After a work order is completed, users can rate the work order and use the comment feature to provide feedback on the handling process.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to modify the database configuration?

The database configuration is stored in `config/settings.yml`, where you can modify the `database` configuration item according to your needs.

### How to add a new API interface?

Create new handling logic in the `api` directory and register the route in `router`. The service layer logic should be placed in the `service` directory.

### How to implement WebSocket real-time task monitoring?

During task execution, the system pushes task status update information to the frontend via WebSocket. The frontend uses the `WebSocket` interface to receive and dynamically display task execution logs.
