# Smart-API Work Order System

The Smart-API Work Order System is a backend management system developed in Go, with a frontend-backend separation architecture. It uses the Gin framework for the backend and Vue.js with Element UI for the frontend. The system aims to efficiently manage work orders, supporting task assignment, execution monitoring, real-time updates, and more.

This is a front-end and back-end separated permission management system based on Gin + Vue + Element UI OR Arco Design OR Ant Design. The system setup is extremely simple, requiring only the configuration of the database connection in the settings file. The system supports multiple commands for operations, and migration commands make it easier to initialize database information. Service commands simplify starting the API service.

- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite
- **Other Tools**: Docker, Swagger, GIT

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to install [Go], [Gin], [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) locally.

## üì¶ System Requirements

- Go 1.18 or later
- Node.js v14.16.0 or later
- npm version: 6.14.11
- MySQL or other compatible databases
- Docker, Kubernetes (optional)

### Backend Installation Steps

1. Clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sunwenbo/smart-api.git
    cd smart-api
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. Configure the database connection:

   ```bash
   cp config/settings.full.yml config/settings.yml
   ```

   Modify the database connection information in `config/settings.yml` and ensure the configuration is correct.

4. Initialize the database:

    ```bash
    # For macOS or Linux:
    $ ./smart-api migrate -c config/settings.dev.yml
   
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows:
    $ smart-api.exe migrate -c config/settings.dev.yml
   
    # Start the project (or use an IDE to debug):
    $ ./smart-api server -c config/settings.yml
   
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows:
    $ smart-api.exe server -c config/settings.yml
    ```

5. Add data to the `sys_api` table:

   Use the `-a true` flag to automatically add missing API data when starting the project:

   ```bash
   ./smart-api server -c config/settings.yml -a true

6. Document generation:
   ```bash
   go generate
   ```
7. Start the service:
   ```
   ./smart-api server -c config/settings.yml
   ```

#### Using Docker for Compilation and Start

```azure

```

#### Cross Compilation
   ```bash
   # windows
   env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go

    npm run dev
    ```

4. Access the address:

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:9527` to view the frontend interface.


## Usage Instructions

1. **Login to the system**: Use the default administrator account `admin` to log in.
2. **Create Work Orders**: Go to the task management page, click "Create Work Order", fill in the relevant information, and assign a handler.
3. **Task Execution Monitoring**: You can view the execution status, results, and logs of tasks in real-time through the task execution interface in the system.
4. **Work Order Rating and Comments**: After a work order is completed, users can rate the work order and use the comment feature to provide feedback on the handling process.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to modify the database configuration?

The database configuration is stored in `config/settings.yml`, where you can modify the `database` configuration item according to your needs.

### How to add a new API interface?

Create new handling logic in the `api` directory and register the route in `router`. The service layer logic should be placed in the `service` directory.

### How to implement WebSocket real-time task monitoring?

During task execution, the system pushes task status update information to the frontend via WebSocket. The frontend uses the `WebSocket` interface to receive and dynamically display task execution logs.
